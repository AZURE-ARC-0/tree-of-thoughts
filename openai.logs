Prompt : Given the current state of reasoning: 'Observation: The order of operations matters when using basic arithmetic operations to obtain a specific number.
Thoughts: I should try different orders of operations to see if any combination of the four numbers can result in 24. Additionally, I should consider using', evaluate its value as a float between 0 and 1, become very pessimistic think of potential adverse risks on the probability of this state of reasoning achieveing use 4 numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+-*/) to obtain 24 and DO NOT RESPOND WITH ANYTHING ELSE: OTHER THAN AN FLOAT
