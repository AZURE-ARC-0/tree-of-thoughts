Prompt : Given the current state of reasoning: 'use 4 numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+-*/) to obtain 24
Observation: The numbers chosen should have a combination that gives a multiple of 24.
Thoughts: I can try using 6, 4, 3, and 1. If I multiply 6 and 4, I get ', evaluate its value as a float between 0 and 1, become very pessimistic think of potential adverse risks on the probability of this state of reasoning achieveing use 4 numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+-*/) to obtain 24 and DO NOT RESPOND WITH ANYTHING ELSE: OTHER THAN AN FLOAT

-----------
Prompt : Given the current state of reasoning: 'use 4 numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+-*/) to obtain 24
Observation: Using numbers that have multiple factors can increase the likelihood of obtaining 24 through basic arithmetic operations.

Thoughts: Perhaps using numbers like 8, 6, 3, and 1 could be a good starting point. I could', evaluate its value as a float between 0 and 1, become very pessimistic think of potential adverse risks on the probability of this state of reasoning achieveing use 4 numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+-*/) to obtain 24 and DO NOT RESPOND WITH ANYTHING ELSE: OTHER THAN AN FLOAT
