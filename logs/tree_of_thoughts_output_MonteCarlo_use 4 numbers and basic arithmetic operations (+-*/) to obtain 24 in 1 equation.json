        "use 4 numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+-*/) to obtain 24 in 1 equation | Observation: The numbers given are not specified, so we can choose any four numbers that can be used to obtain 24.\nThoughts: We can start by selecting two numbers and performing all possible arithmetic operations on them to see if any of them result in 24. If not, we can move on to selecting another two numbers and repeating the process until we find a solution.\n\nObservation: Multiplication and division operations have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction operations.\nThoughts: We can use this to our advantage by first performing multiplication and division operations on the numbers before performing addition and subtraction operations.\n\nObservation: Using fractions or decimals as intermediate results may make the equation more complex and harder to solve.\nThoughts: We should try to avoid using fractions or decimals as intermediate results and instead try to simplify the equation as much as possible.\n\nObservation: Using negative numbers may make the equation more complex and harder to solve.\nThoughts: We should avoid using negative numbers as much as possible and instead try to use positive numbers only.\n\nSolution: (4*3)+(2*1) = 12+2 = 14, then 14*2 = 28, then 28/4 = 7, then 7-3 = 4.
