Step: 1, State: 


Input: 2 8 8 14
Possible next steps:
2 + 8 = 10 (left: 8 10 14)
8 / 2 = 4 (left: 4 8 14)
14 + 2 = 16 (left: 8 8 16)
2 * 8 = 16 (left: 8 14 16)
8 - 2 = 6 (left: 6 8 14)
14 - 8 = 6 (left: 2 6 8)
14 /  2 = 7 (left: 7 8 8)
14 - 2 = 12 (left: 8 8 12)
Input: use 4 numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+-*/) to obtain 24 in 1 equation
Possible next steps:



, Action: Observation: The numbers given are all even.
Observation: Multiplying any two of the numbers gives a result that is a multiple of 16.
Observation: Dividing any of the numbers by 2 gives an even number.
Thoughts: We can use these observations to our advantage and try to find a solution that involves multiplication and division by 2 to get to a number that is a multiple of 16, and then add or subtract the remaining numbers to get to 24., Value 0.5, Best State: None, Best Value: -inf
